But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee



=== WHEN ADAPTIVE HUFFMAN IS BETTER THAN STATIC HUFFMAN ===

IMPORTANT: Adaptive Huffman typically has WORSE compression ratios than 
static Huffman on static files (as you can see in the test results above).

However, Adaptive Huffman is better in these PRACTICAL scenarios:

1. STREAMING DATA (Real-time Processing)
   - Live video/audio compression
   - Network packet compression
   - Chat/messaging apps
   - You cannot wait to see all data before starting compression

2. SINGLE-PASS REQUIREMENT
   - Static Huffman needs TWO passes (analyze frequencies, then compress)
   - Adaptive Huffman needs ONE pass (compress while building tree)
   - Better for large files where reading twice is expensive

3. UNKNOWN DATA LENGTH
   - When you don't know how much data is coming
   - Continuous data streams
   - Real-time sensors/IoT devices

4. MEMORY EFFICIENCY
   - No need to store entire file in memory
   - No need to store separate frequency table
   - Tree is built on-the-fly

CONCLUSION: Adaptive Huffman trades ~2-5% worse compression ratio for 
the ability to compress data in real-time without seeing it all first.
